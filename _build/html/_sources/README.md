CS-5242 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project

This repository is organised in the following manner:

1. The project report is available at `_build/html/index.html` - when this file is opened in a browser, a screen similar to the one below shows up:

![report_ss](./data/other/report_ss.png)

This report is generated using Jupyter notebooks and are presented in an easily navigable book-like interface.

2. The models are implemented in respective notebooks under the folder `notebooks/` and the related data are stored under `data/` with `data/raw_images` holding all the image content used in our data and label information available at `data/processed/labels.csv`.

3. Common functions are extracted into respective python files in `src/`.

Feel free to contact any of the contributors in case of any issues with the repository.
